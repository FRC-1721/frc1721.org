            We’re a FIRST (For Inspiration & Recognition of Science and
            Technology) Robotics Competition team that serves Concord High
            School and the surrounding community. Every year, our team builds a
            robot during a six-week build season that adheres to the FIRST
            competition guidelines. We also collaborate with the Concord
            community to inspire younger students and cultivate their interest
            in engineering, all while sharing our fascination and passion for
            robotics. We like to think of our team as more than just a club;
            we’re all-inclusive and we foster connections among individuals who
            share the same interest—STEM! Everyone is welcome to join, and there
            are no prerequisites.

          <h2>What is FIRST?</h2>
          <div>
            FIRST For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology was
            founded by Dean Kamen and Woodie Flowers in 1989, and primarily
            serves to get kids excited about engineering and technology.
            <br /><br />
            FIRST encourages students to be kind and professional both on and
            off the field, and rewards students and teams for helping their
            community, fellow teams, and eachother to succeed. FIRST promotes
            students to become passionate hard-working individuals while
            spreading the values of FIRST itself - inspiring and recognizing
            achievement in Science and Technology.
